Some of the most basic commands for commit are:

git commit

git commit -m "message" // avoid the text editor and directly leave a messgae.

git commit -a //commit all files that have been staged.

git commit -am

git commit --amend  // dont create a new commit but add this to the previous one.

***Note:


Note that many developers also like to use the present tense in their commit messages. This makes them read more like actions on the repository, which makes many of the history-rewriting operations more intuitive.
