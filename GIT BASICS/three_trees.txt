the three trees of GIT are:
The working directory
the staging area (after add, before commit)
the commit history (not the repository? strange)

git add commands:

git add

git add -p
the above:
git add -p
Begin an interactive staging session that lets you choose portions of a file to add to the next commit. This will present you with a chunk of changes and prompt you for a command. Use y to stage the chunk, n to ignore the chunk, s to split it into smaller chunks, e to manually edit the chunk, and q to exit.

git status

git restore --staged <file> //to undo a staging

git commit

git reset <file> // to undo a commit
