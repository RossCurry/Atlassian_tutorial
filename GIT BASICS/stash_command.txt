git stash

Used to set apart not completed files, so as not to be committed.
This will also work on already staged files.(added files).

***Note that the stash is local 
to your Git repository; 
stashes are not transferred to the server when you push.

**Git stash will only work on files that have been previously staged.

Or files that have been ignored.

This can all be changed however:

git stash -u  // to include untracked files

git stash -a   // to include ignored files


Undo a stash

git stash pop
